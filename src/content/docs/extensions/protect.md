`totalcms/protect` — bundled with Total CMS. Adds a `protect` [page feature](/site-builder/overview#page-features-middleware/) that gates a page behind a **numeric passcode**. Visitors see a simple code-entry form; once they enter the correct passcode, a cookie remembers them for 7 days. No login required, no accounts — just a shareable code.

## Use cases

- **Client previews.** Share a 4-digit code over Slack/email so the client can see a work-in-progress page without a T3 login.
- **Soft launches.** Hide a page from the public until you're ready, then share the code with early testers.
- **Draft staging.** Designers or copywriters reviewing a draft page before it goes live.
- **Lightweight gating.** When you don't need full auth/access-groups — just a quick "is this person meant to be here" check.

## Enabling

1. Go to **Admin → Extensions**, find **Protect**, click **Enable** (or run `tcms extension:enable totalcms/protect`).
2. In **Admin → Extensions → Protect**, set the **Default Passcode** (required). Every protected page uses this unless it overrides it.
3. Open a page in **Site Builder**, tick `protect` under **Features**. **Attaching the feature is what gates the page** — using the default passcode above.
4. *(Optional)* Override the default for this page in its **Page Data** JSON field:
   ```json
   {
     "passcode": "8675",
     "promptTitle": "Client Preview"
   }
   ```
5. Visitors without the cookie see a passcode prompt. Once they enter the correct code, they're through. **Logged-in operators bypass the prompt** and see the page directly, so they can preview it.

> **Operators-only mode.** If `protect` is attached but no passcode is configured anywhere (no extension default *and* no page override), the page **fails closed**: logged-in operators still see it, but the public gets the prompt with no valid code to enter. Set a passcode to let the public in.

## Extension settings (defaults)

Set in **Admin → Extensions → Protect**. These apply to every page with `protect` attached, unless the page overrides them in its Page Data.

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `passcode` | string | `1234` | **Required.** The numeric passcode visitors enter. Change it from the shipped default before going live. |
| `promptTitle` | string | `"Enter passcode to view"` | Heading shown on the passcode form. |
| `cookieHours` | number | `168` | How long a visitor stays unlocked after entering the passcode, in hours (168 = 7 days). Set to `0` for a session cookie that clears when the browser closes. |
| `globalScope` | toggle | `false` | **Site-wide passcode.** Lock the whole site behind one shared passcode and a single unlock cookie instead of per-page locking. When on, every protected page uses the Default Passcode and per-page passcodes/`protectScope` groups are ignored — enter the code once and the whole site unlocks. |

## Per-page configuration

Optionally override the defaults inside the page's **Page Data** JSON field. Both keys are read from `page.data.*`.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `passcode` | string | extension default | The numeric passcode for this page. Empty/missing → falls back to the extension default; if that's also empty the page is operators-only (fails closed). |
| `promptTitle` | string | extension default | Heading shown on the passcode form. Customize per page for context ("Client Preview", "Early Access", etc.). |
| `protectScope` | string | (page id) | Shared unlock group. Pages with the same `protectScope` **and** the same passcode share one cookie — enter the code on any of them and the whole group unlocks. Leave it unset to gate each page independently. |

### Sharing one passcode across pages

By default each page has its own cookie (`tcms_protect_<page-id>`), so a visitor re-enters the code on every protected page — even when those pages use the same passcode. To gate a whole *section* behind a single code, give the pages a shared `protectScope`:

```json
{ "passcode": "8675", "protectScope": "client-preview" }
```

Put that on `/about`, `/pricing`, and `/roadmap` and a visitor who unlocks any one of them is unlocked for all three (the cookie becomes `tcms_protect_client-preview`). The scope is reduced to a cookie-safe token (letters, numbers, `-`, `_`); spaces and symbols are stripped.

To gate the **entire site** behind one code without tagging each page, turn on the **Site-wide passcode** (`globalScope`) extension setting instead — it forces every protected page into one shared scope using the Default Passcode, so there's nothing to configure per page.

## How it works

1. **Logged-in operator** → middleware returns null, page renders so they can preview it. (Uses `AccessManager::userLoggedIn` against the operator collection — front-end members from public registration do *not* bypass.)
2. **GET without cookie** → renders a minimal passcode form (HTTP 403, `noindex` meta tag).
3. **POST with correct passcode** → sets an HttpOnly cookie `tcms_protect_<page-id>` containing an HMAC of the passcode, then 302 redirects to the same URL.
4. **GET with valid cookie** → middleware returns null, page renders normally.
5. **POST with wrong passcode** → re-renders the form with an "Incorrect passcode" error.

The form uses `inputmode="numeric"` so mobile devices show a number pad.

## Cookie details

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Name | `tcms_protect_<page-id>` |
| Value | HMAC-SHA256 of the passcode, keyed by page ID |
| TTL | Configurable via the `cookieHours` setting — default 7 days (168h); `0` = session cookie |
| Path | `/` |
| SameSite | `Lax` |
| HttpOnly | Yes |

The HMAC is deterministic per page + passcode — re-entering the code isn't needed within the TTL. Changing the passcode in page data automatically invalidates all existing cookies for that page.

## Security notes

This is **not** a replacement for T3's auth system. It's a convenience gate — appropriate for "keep casual visitors out" scenarios, not for protecting sensitive data. Specifically:

- The passcode is stored in plain text in page data (visible to any admin).
- There's no brute-force protection beyond what your web server / CDN provides.
- Cookie-based — clearing cookies or using a fresh browser requires re-entry.
- A motivated attacker with access to the page data JSON can read the passcode directly.

For real access control, use the `auth` page feature with access groups.

## Failure modes

- **`passcode` empty or missing everywhere** → page **fails closed**: operators preview it, the public sees the prompt with no valid code (operators-only).
- **`passcode` non-string** (e.g. integer) in page data → treated as missing; falls back to the extension default.
- **Cookie from an old passcode** → HMAC won't match; visitor is re-prompted.

## Testing locally

```bash
# See the passcode form
curl -sD - http://yoursite.test/preview

# Submit the correct passcode
curl -sD - -X POST -d 'passcode=8675' http://yoursite.test/preview
# → 302 with Set-Cookie: tcms_protect_preview=...

# Visit with the cookie
curl -sD - -b 'tcms_protect_preview=<hmac-value>' http://yoursite.test/preview
# → 200 (page renders)
```

## Disabling

Go to **Admin → Extensions → Protect** and click **Disable**, or run:

```bash
tcms extension:disable totalcms/protect
```

When disabled, `protect` disappears from the page-features picker. Pages that already have it ticked will silently skip it.

## Implementation notes

The middleware lives at `resources/extensions/totalcms/protect/ProtectMiddleware.php`. It reads page data and request cookies/body and renders a self-contained HTML form. Its one runtime dependency is an injected `isAdmin` closure (wired in `Extension.php` to `AccessManager::userLoggedIn`) so logged-in operators bypass the gate.
