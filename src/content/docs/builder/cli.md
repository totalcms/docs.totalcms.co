The Site Builder provides CLI commands for scaffolding sites from starter templates.

## Builder Commands

### `builder:init`

Scaffold a new site from a bundled starter template.

```bash
tcms builder:init business
tcms builder:init --list
tcms builder:init blog --force
tcms builder:init --json
```

#### What It Does

1. Copies template files (layouts, pages, partials) from the starter into `tcms-data/builder/`
2. Creates the `builder-pages` collection with the `builder-page` schema (if it doesn't exist)
3. Creates page objects from the starter's manifest with routes and templates

#### Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `starter` | No | Starter template name. Omit to list available starters. |

#### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--list, -l` | List available starters and exit |
| `--force, -f` | Overwrite existing templates if present |
| `--json` | Output result as JSON |

#### Available Starters

| Starter | Pages | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `minimal` | Home | Single page with clean layout |
| `business` | Home, About, Services, Contact | Professional business site |
| `blog` | Home, Blog, Blog Post, About | Blog-focused site with dynamic post routing |
| `portfolio` | Home, Work, About, Contact | Portfolio site with project cards |

#### Example Workflow

```bash
# See what's available
tcms builder:init --list

# Scaffold a business site
tcms builder:init business

# Visit your site — routing is automatic, no generation step needed
```

#### Note

Since the Site Builder uses middleware-based routing, pages are routed dynamically from the collection data. There is no generation or deployment step — pages work immediately after creating them in the admin.
