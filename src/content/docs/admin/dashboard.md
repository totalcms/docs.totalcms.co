The Total CMS Admin Dashboard is your central hub for managing all content, users, and system settings. This guide will help you navigate and utilize the dashboard effectively.

(This primarily serves as an outline for future docs...)

## Dashboard Layout

The admin interface is organized into several main sections:

### 1. Navigation Menu
Located on the left side, the navigation menu provides quick access to:

- **Dashboard** - Overview and quick stats
- **Collections** - Manage your content types
- **Schemas** - Define and edit data structures
- **Documentation** - This help system
- **Tools** - Utilities like import/export, job queue
- **Settings** - System configuration

#### The More menu

The sidebar has room for a dozen icons before it gets crowded, and extensions can add more. Under **Settings → Dashboard → More Menu**, check any sidebar items you rarely use. They leave the sidebar and move into a **More** (⋮) menu at its bottom, where they stay one click away rather than disappearing. Items added by extensions are listed there too. Nothing is locked: if you never use Automations or Site Builder, tuck them away; they are still reachable from More and from Quick Navigation.

### 2. Main Content Area
The central area displays the current page content, forms, and data tables.

### 3. Top Bar
Contains:
- Search functionality
- User profile menu
- Quick actions
- System notifications

## Key Features

### Collection Management

Collections are the heart of Total CMS. From the dashboard, you can:

1. **View All Collections** - See all available content types at a glance
2. **Quick Actions** - Add new content, view collection, or edit schema

Example collections include:
- Blog posts
- Image galleries
- File repositories
- Custom business objects

### Data Tables

Most collection views use interactive data tables that support:

- **Sorting** - Click column headers to sort
- **Filtering** - Search within collections
- **Pagination** - Navigate large datasets
- **Bulk Actions** - Select multiple items for operations
- **Quick Edit** - Inline editing for simple changes (see below)

### Editing in the Table

Simple values can be changed without opening the object. Hover a cell and a
pencil appears at its right edge; click it and the cell becomes that one
field, with a check mark to save and a cross to cancel beside it. Enter saves
from a single-line input, Escape cancels, and the cell shows the new value as
soon as the save lands. While a cell is open, no other cell offers a pencil.
Nothing else on the page reloads, and the value is saved exactly as the
object form would save it: a toggle stays a boolean, a list stays a list,
rich text stays HTML.

The pencil appears on text, textarea, number, range, price, toggle,
checkbox, select, radio, multiselect, checklist, date, datetime, time, url,
email, phone, color, list and styled text fields. Identity fields (`id`,
slugs), passwords and secrets, readonly fields such as the created and
updated timestamps, and composites (images, galleries, files, depots, decks,
cards, code) do not offer it: open the object to edit those. A field the
current user's access group cannot change is refused the same way it is on
the object form.

Two things decide whether a user gets the pencil at all. **Settings →
Dashboard → Inline Editing** is the site-wide master switch: turn it off and
the pencil disappears from every collection table for everyone, super admins
included, and an inline save is refused even if something asks for one
directly. With it on, the **Inline Editing** permission on the user's access
group decides who may use it, and the user must still have `update` rights on
that collection. Groups saved before the permission existed keep inline
editing, so nothing changes until you turn something off.

### Form Builder

The form system automatically generates input forms based on your schemas:

- **Smart Field Types** - Appropriate inputs for each data type
- **Validation** - Real-time and server-side validation
- **File Uploads** - Drag-and-drop media uploads
- **Rich Text Editing** - WYSIWYG editor for content
- **Relationships** - Link content between collections

### Activity Feed

The dashboard homepage shows recent activity:

- Recently modified objects
- User login activity
- System events
- Job queue status
