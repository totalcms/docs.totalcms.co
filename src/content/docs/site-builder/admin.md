since: "3.5.0"
---
The Builder section in the admin provides page management, a template editor, file tree, drag-drop reorder, live preview, and snapshot-based version history — all accessible from the sidebar.

## Accessing the Builder

The Builder nav item appears in the admin sidebar for all users with template access permissions. It replaces the previous Templates section.

Navigate to **Admin > Builder** to access the interface.

## Overview Page

**Route:** `/admin/builder`

The overview page shows:

- **Template counts** — number of layouts, pages, partials, and macros
- **Getting started guide** — steps for new users

## Sidebar

The left sidebar is divided into two sections separated by a divider:

### Site Pages Section

Lists all page objects from the `builder-pages` collection as a tree. Each page shows its title and links to the page edit form. Click a page to edit its metadata (title, route, template, image, status, page data, etc.).

Pages are displayed in the order defined by the order file (`tcms-data/{collection}/.order.json`) — see [Reordering Pages](#reordering-pages). Visual cues help you scan the tree quickly:

- **Home icon** — the page mapped to `/` (the homepage)
- **Draft badge** — pages with `draft: true` (excluded from routing)
- **Hidden-in-nav style** — pages with `nav: false` (routed but not in menus)
- **Folder chevron** — pages with children, collapsed/expanded by clicking

### Templates Section

Displays all builder templates organized by category:

- **layouts/** — base HTML structures
- **pages/** — page content templates (also used for collection-URL matches: `pages/{collection-id}.twig`)
- **partials/** — reusable fragments
- **macros/** — Twig macros
- **whitelabel/** — admin branding overrides

Each category is collapsible. Click any template to open it in the editor.

### Filter

A search filter at the top of the sidebar matches against both **page titles** and **template filenames**. The filter narrows the visible tree as you type — folders with no matching descendants collapse out of view.

### Footer Buttons

The sidebar footer contains two buttons:

- **+ New Page** — create a new page object (route, template, image, status, etc.)
- **+ New Template** — create a new template file

## Page Management

Pages are managed directly within the Builder — the `builder-pages` collection is hidden from the standard Collections sidebar to keep page management centralized.

### Creating a Page

**Route:** `/admin/builder/page/add`

Click **+ New Page** in the sidebar footer. Fill in the page fields — see [Page Schema Fields](/site-builder/overview#page-schema-fields/) for the full list. Required fields are **Title** and **Template**.

After saving, you're redirected to the page edit form.

### Editing a Page

**Route:** `/admin/builder/page/{id}`

Click any page in the sidebar to edit its metadata. The form is grouped into sections:

- **Basics** — title, description, image
- **Routing** — route pattern, template, status, redirect
- **Page Data** — JSON editor for `page.data.*` content
- **Sitemap** — `sitemap.xml` inclusion + change frequency + priority

Changes are saved via the standard collection API.

## Reordering Pages

Drag-drop reordering is gated behind an explicit **Reorder** mode — the sidebar tree is read-only by default to prevent accidental drags during normal browsing.

### Enabling Reorder Mode

Click the **Reorder** button at the top of the Site Pages section. The sidebar enters a special mode:

- Page rows become draggable handles
- Drop zones appear between rows when dragging
- The button toggles to **Done** to exit the mode

### What Drag-Drop Does

While in reorder mode, drag pages to:

- **Reorder** within the same level (drop above/below another page)
- **Nest** under another page (drop directly onto a page row)
- **Promote** out of a parent (drop into the root area)

Each drop sends the new tree to `/admin/builder/reorder`. The server reconciles the tree against the page list and writes `tcms-data/{collection}/.order.json` — a single small file write replaces N page-record updates and never triggers an event cascade.

### Why a Separate Order File?

Hierarchy and ordering are stored in `.order.json`, not on the page records themselves. This means:

- A page edit can never silently undo a reorder (the form doesn't carry order data)
- Reordering 50 pages is one file write instead of 50
- No event cascade fires on reorder (no index rebuild, no cache invalidation)

See [Page Order](/site-builder/overview#page-order/) for the file format and reconciliation rules.

## Template Editor

**Route:** `/admin/builder/{category}/{filename}`

The editor opens when you click a template in the file tree. It provides:

### Code Editor

A CodeMirror 6 editor with Twig syntax highlighting. The editor loads the full contents of the selected template file.

### Save Button

Saves the current editor content back to the template file on disk via the template API. Each save automatically captures a snapshot of the previous content — see [Template History](#template-history).

### Preview Pane

Below the editor, a **Preview Page** button + URL input pair lets you render the current editor content (before saving) against live T3 data.

### How Preview Works

The preview posts the in-progress template content (plus an optional URL) to `/admin/builder/preview` and renders the result in an iframe. Two modes depending on whether you supply a preview URL:

#### With a Preview URL

Type a URL (e.g., `/blog/my-post`, `/about`) into the input and click **Preview Page**. The URL is run through the page router so the template renders against the same context the visitor would see:

- **Builder page match** — the template gets `page.*` populated from the matched record
- **Collection URL match** — the template gets `object.*` populated from the matched object plus `params.*` for any captured placeholders
- **Catch-all match** — works the same as builder pages (the placeholder values flow through to `params.*`)

This is the only way to preview templates that depend on dynamic data — for example, `pages/blog.twig` (a collection-URL template) needs an `object` to render anything meaningful, and the `previewUrl` provides it.

#### Without a Preview URL

If the URL input is empty, the service falls back to a path-based context:

- For `pages/*.twig`: scans the page index for the first page using this template and renders against that page's record
- For everything else (layouts/partials/macros): renders with an empty `page` and empty `params`

This works fine for simple page templates that don't need URL-bound data.

### Refresh / Close Buttons

Two icon buttons in the preview header:

- **Refresh** — re-renders the iframe with the current editor content (useful after typing edits)
- **Close** — hides the preview pane

The preview iframe runs in a `sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-forms"` so dynamic JS in your templates works as it would on the live site.

### Twig Errors in Preview

If the rendered template throws (syntax error, undefined variable, etc.), the preview pane shows a styled error box with the exception message instead of failing silently or breaking the layout.

## Template History

Every save captures a snapshot of the **previous** template content under `tcms-data/builder/.history/{path}/{timestamp}.twig`. The most recent 50 versions per template are retained automatically — older snapshots are pruned on save.

### Use Cases

- Recover from an accidental delete
- Compare an experimental change against the prior version
- Roll a template back without needing git

### Restoring via CLI

Use [`tcms builder:history`](/site-builder/cli#builderhistory/) to list, view, or restore snapshots:

```bash
# List versions
tcms builder:history pages/about

# View a specific snapshot
tcms builder:history pages/about --show=1714588200

# Restore (the current version is snapshotted first, so restore is reversible)
tcms builder:history pages/about --restore=1714588200
```

The restore captures a fresh snapshot of the current content **before** overwriting, so you can always undo a restore by restoring the previous timestamp.

### Storage Layout

Snapshots are organized by template path:

```
tcms-data/builder/.history/
├── layouts/
│   └── default/
│       ├── 1714501200.twig
│       └── 1714588200.twig
├── pages/
│   ├── about/
│   │   └── 1714502500.twig
│   └── blog/
│       └── post/
│           └── 1714503600.twig
└── partials/
    └── nav/
        └── 1714604700.twig
```

Each `.twig` file is the verbatim contents at that point in time. They're small (text-only) and prune automatically — no maintenance required.

## Page Inspector Overlay

When you're logged into the admin and visit a public page that's served by the Builder (a builder page or a collection-URL match), Total CMS injects a small floating chip in the bottom-right corner — the **Page Inspector**.

It surfaces what was actually matched and rendered, so you don't have to guess which page record or template a URL resolved to:

- **Match** — whether the URL resolved to a *builder page* or a *collection record* (with the collection name)
- **Page id** / **Object id** — the record's identifier
- **Template** — the resolved template path
- **Route** — the matched route
- **Status** — the HTTP status the page is configured to return
- **Params** — any URL params extracted from `{slug}`-style placeholders
- **Features** — active page features (middleware) for this page, if any

The chip starts collapsed and expands on click. It also includes an **Edit page** / **Edit object** link that drops you straight into the right editor.

### Dismissing

The `×` button in the chip sets the `tcms_inspector_hidden` cookie for 30 days, hiding the inspector across all pages. Clear that cookie (or use a different browser / incognito session) to bring it back.

### Visibility rules

The inspector is only injected when:

1. The visitor has an active admin session
2. The response is HTML (`text/html`)
3. The dismiss cookie isn't set

It's injected before the last `</body>` in the response, so it can't be served to logged-out visitors via cached HTML — the cache typically lives upstream of the inspector check.

## Live Reload Preview

When Dev Mode is on, any page rendered by the Builder automatically reloads in every connected browser whenever you save a Builder template or page record. No manual refresh, no Vite/Node dependency, works for any page served by the Builder — and broadcast to every visitor, not just the admin who's editing, so the developer + client demo case works out of the box.

Mechanically: the page holds an EventSource connection open to `/livereload/events`. When `TemplateSaver` writes a file, or any record in the pages collection changes, the server bumps a "pulse" timestamp. The endpoint sees the bump and pushes a `reload` event to every connected client, which calls `location.reload()`.

### What triggers a reload

- Saving any Builder template (`.twig` file, including layouts/partials/macros)
- Creating or updating any page record in the Pages collection (route changes, status changes, redirects, the `template` field, etc.)
- Turning **Dev Mode off** — connected clients get one final reload so they end up on a page that no longer carries the live-reload script, instead of looping retries against a 403

Asset rebuilds (CSS, JS) do not trigger a reload — Vite already handles that for projects that use it. If you change a CSS file in your editor, refresh manually or rely on Vite's HMR.

### Why Dev Mode is the gate

Twig caches its rendered output by default. Without Dev Mode, reloading the browser would just show the same stale page — the feature only does useful work when caching is bypassed. Tying it to Dev Mode also means there's a single switch (`Admin > Cache > Dev Mode`) for "I'm actively developing right now" instead of two overlapping toggles.

With Dev Mode off, the script is not injected, the SSE endpoint returns 403, and the feature is fully dormant.

### Visibility rules

The script is injected on every Builder-rendered HTML response when Dev Mode is active. There's no admin-session gate — visitors get the script too. That's intentional: Dev Mode bypasses caching for everyone anyway, and broadcasting reloads makes the "show a client a change live" scenario work without any setup.

### How long-lived connections behave

Each tab opens one connection that lives ~30 seconds before the server closes it; the browser's EventSource auto-reconnects immediately. This caps server worker time without affecting UX. The feature is dev-mode-only, so production traffic never sees these connections.
