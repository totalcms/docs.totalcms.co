T3's OAuth server lets external services — AI clients like Claude Desktop and Cursor, automation platforms like ActivePieces and Zapier, and your own custom integrations — connect to your site without sharing your admin API key. Each connection gets its own set of scoped tokens with explicit consent from the logged-in user, and you can revoke individual connections without touching the others. The consent screen isn't admin-only: any T3 user can approve a connection for themselves, and the resulting token reaches only what their **access groups** already let them do — see [Scopes](#scopes) below.

**OAuth requires Pro edition.** Trials count as Pro for testing.

---

## OAuth vs. API keys

Both authenticate requests to T3's REST API and MCP endpoint. Choose based on the trust model:

| Scenario | Use |
|---|---|
| Your own server-side scripts, cron jobs, CI pipelines | **API key** — simpler, no consent flow |
| Third-party app that needs access to your site | **OAuth** — scoped, revocable, audited |
| AI client (Claude Desktop, Cursor) connecting to your site | **OAuth** — self-registers automatically once you enable dynamic registration |
| ActivePieces, Zapier, n8n workflows | **OAuth** — pre-register a static client in the admin |

The two methods coexist. The same REST and MCP endpoints accept either an `X-API-Key` header or a Bearer token — you don't have to pick one globally.

---

## Initial setup

OAuth requires an RSA signing key pair. T3 never generates this automatically — you run the CLI command once per site:

```bash
tcms oauth:setup
```

This creates `tcms-data/.system/oauth-keys/private.key` and `public.key`, sets `0600` permissions on the private key, and confirms the paths. The command is idempotent — running it a second time does nothing unless you pass `--force`.

```bash
# Rotate keys (invalidates all existing tokens)
tcms oauth:setup --force
```

After generating keys, enable the OAuth server in **Admin → Settings → OAuth Server**.

### Protecting the private key

The private key is the root of trust for every token your site issues. The key lives outside the webroot in `tcms-data/` which is not web-accessible. Ensure your backup process does not expose `private.key` to untrusted parties. If the key is ever compromised, rotate with `--force` immediately — all previously issued tokens become invalid.

---

> **Behind a firewall?** User-agent-filtering WAF rules (7G/8G and similar) block OAuth discovery and token requests from non-browser clients. If a client reports the server as incompatible or a connector asks for manual credentials despite dynamic registration being enabled, check the firewall before the OAuth config — see [MCP Server](/mcp/server/) for the symptom guide.

## Setting up a static client

Use static clients for ActivePieces, Zapier, n8n, or any integration where you control the configuration on both sides. You create the client once in the admin and paste the credentials into the third-party app.

1. Navigate to **Admin → Utilities → OAuth Clients** (`/admin/utils/oauth-clients`).
2. Click **Create Client**.
3. Fill in:
   - **Name** — something you'll recognize ("ActivePieces Production", "Zapier Events Workflow")
   - **Redirect URIs** — the callback URL(s) the third-party app uses. Exact match required, including protocol and trailing slash if the app sends one. Add one per line.
   - **Scopes** — the permissions this client is allowed to request. See the [Scopes reference](#scopes) below.
4. Click **Save**. The client secret is shown **once** — copy it immediately. It is bcrypt-hashed before storage; T3 cannot show it again. If you lose it, delete the client and create a new one.

You'll see two values to carry over to the third-party app:
- **Client ID** — a UUID, public
- **Client Secret** — the value shown once

---

## Endpoint URLs

Every OAuth endpoint is discoverable via the metadata document at `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`. The four URLs you'll paste into third-party app connection forms are:

```
Authorization endpoint:  https://your-site/oauth/authorize
Token endpoint:          https://your-site/oauth/token
Revocation endpoint:     https://your-site/oauth/revoke
JWKS endpoint:           https://your-site/.well-known/jwks.json
```

Replace `https://your-site` with your actual domain.

---

## Connecting ActivePieces

In ActivePieces, create a new HTTP connection with OAuth 2.0:

- **Client ID** — paste from the admin client page
- **Client Secret** — paste what was shown at creation
- **Authorization URL** — `https://your-site/oauth/authorize`
- **Token URL** — `https://your-site/oauth/token`
- **Scopes** — the scopes your flow needs (space-separated, e.g. `cms:read mcp:tools`)

When you click Connect, ActivePieces opens the T3 consent screen in a popup. Log in as a site admin and approve the requested scopes. ActivePieces stores the resulting tokens and handles refresh automatically.

---

## Connecting Zapier

In a Zapier custom OAuth app or via Zapier's advanced auth settings:

- **Client ID / Client Secret** — from the admin client page
- **Authorization URL** — `https://your-site/oauth/authorize`
- **Token URL** — `https://your-site/oauth/token`
- **Scope** — space-separated scope list

Zapier's test step triggers the consent flow. Approve it from a T3 admin session.

---

## Connecting Claude Desktop or Cursor

AI clients that follow the MCP spec auto-discover everything — provided you have turned on **Allow Dynamic Registration**, which is **off by default** and must be enabled first.

In Claude Desktop, add a remote MCP server and paste your site URL:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"my-site": {
			"url": "https://your-site/mcp"
		}
	}
}
```

Dynamic registration is **off by default** (see [Dynamic registration toggle](#dynamic-registration-toggle)), so enable it first if you want this zero-touch flow. With it on, Claude Desktop fetches `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`, self-registers as a client via RFC 7591, and opens the consent screen in your browser. You log in as a T3 admin, review the requested scopes, and approve. Claude Desktop saves the tokens and reconnects automatically on expiry.

Cursor and other conformant MCP clients follow the same pattern. No manual client setup, no secret to paste.

If dynamic registration is left off, you must create a static client in the admin first and configure the MCP client with those credentials manually — the self-registration step gets a 403.

---

## Scopes

Scopes define what an authorized connection can do. When you create a static client you choose which scopes it's allowed to request; when a user approves a connection they see the human-readable description of each scope and can deny the request.

| Scope | Description | REST paths | MCP surface |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cms:read` | Read your content | `GET /api/collections/*`, `GET /api/objects/*` | `query_collection`, `get_object`, `search_collection`, `list_collections`, `search_collections` |
| `cms:write` | Create, update, and delete your content | `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` on `/api/collections/*` and `/api/objects/*` | `create_object`, `update_object`, `patch_object` |
| `cms:admin` | Administer your site | `/api/schemas/*`, `/api/cache/*`, `/api/extensions/*` | `create_schema`, `update_schema`, `delete_schema`, `create_collection`, `clear_cache`, `list_extensions` |
| `mcp:tools` | Call AI tools on your site | (MCP only) | Authorizes all `tools/call` requests |
| `mcp:resources` | Read addressable AI resources | (MCP only) | Authorizes `resources/read`, `resources/subscribe`, `resources/list` |

`cms:admin` implies `cms:read` and `cms:write` — you don't need all three for a full-access connection.

**Scope is not the whole story — your access groups cap what a token can actually reach.** REST and MCP both resolve a token's real authority as *scope ∩ the approving user's access-group permissions*, the same groups you manage under **Admin → Access Groups**. A `cms:write` token approved by a blogger-group user can write only to the collections that group can create/update in the dashboard — not every collection `cms:write` mentions in the table above. A `cms:read` token similarly only reads what the user's groups (or, for MCP calls only, a collection's own public MCP exposure) allow — REST has no such exposure carve-out; `CollectionAccessMiddleware`'s Bearer branch is a plain group check regardless of the collection's `mcp.access` setting. **Admin (API keys, or a token elevated to the admin persona — see below) bypasses the group check**, same as it always has.

`cms:admin` is additionally **privilege-gated at issuance**: it lands in a token when the approving user is in the **admin group**, OR when their access groups grant at least one `schemas` / `collectionsMeta` / `utils` permission (the same permissions that unlock schema editing, collection settings, or utilities like cache-clearing in the dashboard). For anyone else the requested scope is silently narrowed away — the consent screen doesn't display it, and the issued token doesn't carry it. Holding the scope only grants what those groups actually allow: a non-admin schema editor's `cms:admin` token can create/update/delete the schemas their groups permit, and nothing else — it does not become a full-access admin token. See [Super-admin elevation](#super-admin-elevation) for the separate, stricter bar on becoming the unrestricted admin persona.

### Picking the right scopes

- **Read-only content delivery** (AI agent querying blog posts): `cms:read mcp:tools`
- **Content automation** (ActivePieces creating/updating objects): `cms:read cms:write`
- **Full admin automation** (schema management, cache clearing): `cms:admin mcp:tools`
- **AI client browsing content and using tools**: `cms:read mcp:tools mcp:resources`

Grant the minimum scopes that make the integration work. A compromised token is limited to what was consented.

---

## Token lifetimes and refresh

- **Access tokens** expire after 1 hour by default. They are short-lived by design — a leaked token is useful to an attacker for at most that window.
- **Refresh tokens** expire after 30 days by default. When an access token expires, the connected app presents the refresh token to `POST /oauth/token` to get a new access token without another consent screen.
- **Refresh token rotation** — each refresh issues a new refresh token and invalidates the old one. Presenting a previously-used refresh token (replay attack) revokes the entire grant chain and logs a security alert. The connected app must immediately update the stored token on every refresh.

Both TTLs are configurable in **Admin → Settings → OAuth Server** using PHP `DateInterval` syntax:

| Setting | Default | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Access Token Lifetime | `PT1H` (1 hour) | `PT15M`, `PT2H`, `P1D` |
| Refresh Token Lifetime | `P30D` (30 days) | `P7D`, `P90D`, `P1Y` |

Shorter access token lifetimes reduce the blast radius of a stolen token but increase the frequency of refresh round-trips. The 1h default is the OAuth industry standard middle ground.

---

## Revoking access

### Revoke a specific grant

Navigate to **Admin → Utilities → OAuth Grants** (`/admin/utils/oauth-grants`). You'll see all active grants grouped by client. Click **Revoke** next to any grant to immediately invalidate all access and refresh tokens for that connection. The next request from that app returns 401 and the user must re-authorize.

### Delete a client

In **Admin → Utilities → OAuth Clients**, click **Delete** on any client. This cascades — all active grants for that client are revoked and their tokens become invalid. The connected app cannot reconnect without a new client setup.

### Self-revocation

Connected apps can revoke their own tokens at `POST /oauth/revoke`. This is the RFC-standard way for a user to "disconnect my account" in a third-party app without needing T3 admin access.

---

## Dynamic registration toggle

**Admin → Settings → OAuth Server → Allow Dynamic Registration** (default: off) controls whether `POST /oauth/register` is accessible.

| State | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Off** (default) | `/oauth/register` returns 403. Every integration requires a manually-created static client |
| **On** | AI clients (Claude, Cursor) auto-register and connect without manual setup |

Dynamic registration is **off by default** because `/oauth/register` is an unauthenticated endpoint that writes persistent server state. Note that self-registration alone never grants data access — a registered client still can't get a token until a logged-in admin approves its consent screen — but leaving the endpoint open lets anyone create client records and invites consent-phishing attempts. Turn it **on** when you want the zero-touch AI client flow (type your URL into Claude Desktop and it self-registers); leave it off and create static clients in the admin for each integration otherwise.

Dynamic registration is rate-limited by default (10 registrations/hour per IP) to prevent client-record flooding even when enabled. Adjust in **Settings → OAuth Server → Dynamic Registration Rate Limit**.

---

## Running public-only MCP

**Admin → Settings → OAuth Server → Enable OAuth Server** (default: on) is the master switch for the whole authorization server. Turn it **off** to run a public-only MCP site.

Why you'd want that: some MCP clients — notably claude.ai and the Claude desktop app — demand a login at connector setup whenever they can discover an OAuth server, even though your anonymous public tier would have served them. T3's consent screen requires an operator login, so a site visitor who adds your connector hits a wall they can never pass. With OAuth disabled, those clients see a plain no-auth MCP server and connect anonymously, getting exactly the collections and tools you marked public.

With the switch off:

- All OAuth discovery documents (`/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`, `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`, `/.well-known/jwks.json`) and endpoints (`/oauth/authorize`, `/oauth/token`, `/oauth/register`, `/oauth/revoke`) return 404 — clients read "no OAuth here" through standard discovery failure.
- The MCP discovery document (`/.well-known/mcp.json`) stops advertising `resourceMetadata`.
- Access is anonymous (public persona) or API key (admin persona). The authenticated OAuth tier is unavailable, including for your own connectors.
- Already-issued access tokens expire naturally (default 1 hour) and cannot be refreshed; no new tokens can be issued.
- The per-collection MCP access levels keep working as before — collections marked `authenticated` are simply unreachable until you either re-enable OAuth or query with an API key.

The OAuth Applications admin page stays available so client records survive a temporary switch-off intact. Note that leaving OAuth **enabled** does not block public access at the server — anonymous callers are always served when *Allow Public Access* is on. The switch exists purely because some clients refuse to take the anonymous path while OAuth is discoverable.

---

## Security model

### What OAuth protects

- **Token theft in transit** — tokens are short-lived JWTs over HTTPS. A stolen access token expires within the configured lifetime (default 1h).
- **Refresh token replay** — T3 detects if a previously-used refresh token is presented again and revokes the entire grant chain, limiting the window for a compromised token.
- **Scope creep** — a token's scopes are fixed at consent time. A connected app cannot escalate its own permissions.
- **Redirect URI manipulation** — T3 requires exact-match redirect URIs (no prefix matching, no wildcard) and validates before any redirect happens.
- **Open redirect attacks** — `redirect_uri` is checked against the registered URIs before the auth code is issued. Protocol downgrade (HTTPS → HTTP) is rejected.

### What OAuth does not protect

- **The signing key itself.** If `tcms-data/.system/oauth-keys/private.key` is compromised, rotate immediately with `tcms oauth:setup --force`. All existing tokens become invalid — a disruption, but a manageable one.
- **The admin session that grants consent.** If an attacker controls the T3 admin session during the consent screen, they can authorize malicious scopes. Protect admin login with strong passwords and passkeys.
- **Malicious redirect URIs registered at client creation.** Double-check redirect URIs when creating static clients for third-party apps.

### Public key verification

The JWT access tokens are RS256-signed. Resource servers (or auditing tools) can verify token signatures using the public signing key at `/.well-known/jwks.json`. Tokens are always accepted or rejected by T3 itself — this endpoint exists for third parties that want to introspect tokens independently.

---

## Pruning expired grants and stale clients with `oauth:gc`

OAuth records accumulate over time. Expired access tokens are rejected at the endpoint, but the underlying grant records remain on disk until explicitly pruned. Self-registered clients pile up even faster: MCP clients (claude.ai, Claude Desktop, Cursor) register a fresh client every time a connector is added, so failed or abandoned connection attempts each leave a client record behind. The `oauth:gc` command removes both:

```bash
tcms oauth:gc
```

Output:

```
Pruned 14 expired OAuth grants.
Pruned 6 stale dynamic clients.
  - Anthropic/ClaudeAI (f9920001-…)
  ...
```

The command is safe to run at any time:

- **Grants** are removed only after their refresh token has passed its configured lifetime (`oauth.refreshTokenTtl`) — active grants are untouched.
- **Clients** are removed only when they are self-registered (RFC 7591), at least 24 hours old, and hold no active grant. Every completed connection creates a grant at the consent screen, so a grantless dynamic client is a dead registration by definition; the 24-hour floor protects registrations whose user is still mid-consent. Manually configured clients are never touched.

The same client cleanup is available in the admin: the **Remove stale clients** button on the OAuth Applications page (Utilities → OAuth Applications) prunes the self-registered list on demand.

### Automatic daily cleanup

You normally don't need to schedule anything: the same sweep runs opportunistically once per day, triggered by ordinary OAuth traffic (token refreshes and client registrations). Any site with an active connector — or one still receiving connection attempts — cleans itself. Sites that never use OAuth never pay the cost.

### Running on a schedule

If you prefer an explicit schedule (or want cleanup on a site with no OAuth traffic at all), run the command via cron. Add a line to the crontab of the web server user (typically `www-data` or the PHP-FPM pool user):

```
0 3 * * * cd /var/www/your-site && php resources/bin/tcms oauth:gc >> tcms-data/.system/logs/oauth-gc.log 2>&1
```

Adjust the path to match your install location. The `>> ... 2>&1` redirect appends output to a log file so you can confirm it ran.

---

## OAuth activity log

Every OAuth lifecycle event is appended to `tcms-data/.system/logs/mcp.log` under the `oauth-activity` channel. The log is the authoritative record for incident response — if a token was issued, refreshed, or revoked, it's here.

### Event types

| Type | Level | When it appears |
|---|---|---|
| `client.created` | INFO | A new static client is saved in the admin |
| `client.dynamic_registered` | INFO | Dynamic registration via `POST /oauth/register` |
| `client.deleted` | INFO | A client is deleted from the admin (cascades to all grants) |
| `consent.granted` | INFO | A user approves the consent screen |
| `consent.denied` | INFO | A user clicks Deny on the consent screen |
| `token.issued` | INFO | An access token is minted after code exchange |
| `token.refreshed` | INFO | An access token is renewed via refresh token |
| `token.revoked` | INFO | A token is revoked via the admin or `POST /oauth/revoke` |
| `scope.rejected` | INFO | A request is rejected because the token lacks the required scope |
| `security.refresh_replay` | **WARNING** | A previously-used refresh token is presented — the entire grant chain is revoked immediately |
| `security.rate_limit` | **WARNING** | The token endpoint or dynamic-registration rate limit is hit |

`WARNING`-level events are security signals. A `security.refresh_replay` entry means a refresh token was replayed — either a bug in the connected app (it didn't update its stored token after the last refresh) or an active theft attempt. The grant chain is revoked automatically; review the `client_id` and `grant_id` fields and determine whether the connection needs re-authorization.

### Log format

Each line is a Monolog-formatted JSON record:

```
[2026-05-21T10:22:33-07:00] oauth-activity.INFO: OAuth token issued {"type":"token.issued","client_id":"3e4b...","user_id":"admin","scopes":["cms:read","mcp:tools"]}
[2026-05-21T10:22:38-07:00] oauth-activity.WARNING: OAuth refresh token replay — chain revoked {"type":"security.refresh_replay","client_id":"3e4b...","grant_id":"7f9a...","token_hash":"d3e8f1a2…"}
```

The `token_hash` in replay events is a truncated prefix of the presented token's hash — enough to correlate with a specific request in your web server access log without exposing the full token value.

---

## OAuth tokens and MCP scopes

Tokens issued through the OAuth flow authenticate requests to `/mcp` — but only if they carry an `mcp:*` scope. A token with `cms:read` alone, without any `mcp:*` scope, receives a **403** on every MCP request regardless of what collections it could otherwise reach.

The token's scopes determine which tools and resources appear in `tools/list` and `resources/list`. An agent whose token lacks `mcp:resources` cannot subscribe to change notifications; one without `mcp:prompts` cannot invoke prompts. T3 filters the surface at session initialization so agents only see what their token can actually call.

### Super-admin elevation

A token is elevated to the full **admin** persona — every tool and REST path, unrestricted, same surface as an API key — when **both** of these hold:

1. The user who approved the consent screen is in the **admin** group (the same check that guards the admin UI), and
2. the token carries the `cms:admin` scope.

Either alone stays at the authenticated tier: an admin who granted a read-only token gets exactly the read-only assistant they chose, and a non-admin requesting `cms:admin` gets the scope but not the elevation. This is the recommended way for operators to manage their site from Claude — compared to pasting an API key it's per-connection revocable, activity-logged, and the access token expires hourly.

This is a **stricter** bar than simply holding `cms:admin` — see the widened issuance rule above. A non-admin user whose groups grant, say, `schemas` permission can request and receive `cms:admin`, and that token really does authorize schema writes over REST and MCP — but it never elevates to the unrestricted admin persona, because admin-group membership is the one requirement group grants can't substitute for. Elevation is all-or-nothing by design; a token that reaches everything is meant to mean the approving human can reach everything too.

For a complete breakdown of which scopes unlock which MCP capabilities, and a worked example of configuring Claude Desktop with a static OAuth client, see [Connecting an AI client via OAuth](/mcp/server#connecting-an-ai-client-via-oauth/).

## Settings reference

Settings live in **Admin → Settings → OAuth Server**.

| Key | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `oauth.enabled` | `true` | Master switch. Off = every OAuth endpoint and discovery document returns 404 — see [Running public-only MCP](#running-public-only-mcp) |
| `oauth.dynamicRegistration` | `false` | Enable RFC 7591 self-registration at `/oauth/register` (off by default — unauthenticated endpoint) |
| `oauth.accessTokenTtl` | `PT1H` | PHP DateInterval — access token lifetime |
| `oauth.refreshTokenTtl` | `P30D` | PHP DateInterval — refresh token lifetime |
| `oauth.authCodeTtl` | `PT10M` | PHP DateInterval — authorization code lifetime (should stay short) |
| `oauth.tokenEndpointLimit` | `60` | `/oauth/token` rate limit per IP per minute. `0` = disabled |
| `oauth.dynamicRegistrationLimit` | `10` | `/oauth/register` rate limit per IP per hour. `0` = disabled |

---

## Troubleshooting

**"OAuth signing keys not configured"**

Run `tcms oauth:setup` and confirm the keys were written to `tcms-data/.system/oauth-keys/`. Verify the paths in your `tcms.php` config if you've customized the data directory.

**"OAuth server requires Pro edition"**

Upgrade to Pro or use API key auth for your integration instead. Trials count as Pro — if you're on a trial and seeing this, contact support.

**"Invalid client" or "unauthorized_client"**

The `client_id` doesn't match any registered client, or the `client_secret` is wrong. For static clients, confirm you pasted the secret correctly (it's only shown once — recreate the client if you've lost it). For dynamic clients, the registration may have expired or been deleted by an admin.

**"Invalid redirect_uri" or "Redirect URI mismatch"**

T3 requires an exact string match including protocol (`https://`), hostname, path, and trailing slash. Check that the redirect URI registered in the T3 admin matches exactly what the third-party app sends in the authorization request.

**"Insufficient scope" (403)**

The token was authorized with a narrower scope than the operation requires. Example: a token with only `cms:read` calling `query_collection` on an admin-access collection, or a token without `mcp:tools` calling a tool. Either re-authorize with broader scopes or check whether the collection's `mcp.access` setting is more restrictive than intended.

**429 on `/oauth/token`**

The token endpoint rate limit was hit. Default is 60 requests/minute per IP. The response includes `Retry-After`. Integrations that refresh tokens in tight loops should back off. Adjust **Token Endpoint Rate Limit** in settings if your integration legitimately needs a higher ceiling.

**Tokens stop working after key rotation**

Running `tcms oauth:setup --force` generates a new key pair and immediately invalidates all previously issued tokens. All connected apps must re-authorize. Schedule key rotation during a maintenance window if your site has active integrations.
