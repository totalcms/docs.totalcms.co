This guide covers best practices for deploying Total CMS sites to production and managing deployments with version control.

## Git Configuration

When using Git for version control, add the following to your `.gitignore` file to exclude Total CMS runtime files:

```gitignore
# Total CMS 3
tcms-data
**/tcms/cache
**/tcms/logs
**/tcms/tmp
```

### What These Directories Contain

| Directory | Purpose | Why Ignore |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| `tcms-data` | All CMS content (collections, files, uploads) | Content is environment-specific and managed through the CMS |
| `tcms/cache` | Twig template cache, computed data | Generated at runtime, varies by environment |
| `tcms/logs` | Application logs | Environment-specific, should not be shared |
| `tcms/tmp` | Temporary files (uploads in progress, etc.) | Transient data |

### Files to Commit

You should commit your customization files:

- `tcms.php` - Site configuration
- Custom templates in your theme directory
- Custom schemas if you've created any

## Clearing Cache on Deployment

After deploying new code or templates, clear the cache to ensure visitors see the latest content. Total CMS provides an emergency cache clear endpoint that can be called from deployment scripts.

### Using curl

The simplest approach is to call the cache clear endpoint directly:

```bash
curl -s https://example.com/tcms/emergency/cache/clear
```

For formatted output:

```bash
curl -s https://example.com/tcms/emergency/cache/clear | jq
```

### Example Deployment Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

SITE_URL="https://example.com"

# Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# Clear cache
echo "Clearing cache..."
RESPONSE=$(curl -s "$SITE_URL/tcms/emergency/cache/clear")

# Check if successful
if echo "$RESPONSE" | grep -q '"success":true'; then
    echo "Cache cleared successfully"
else
    echo "Warning: Cache clear may have had issues"
    echo "$RESPONSE"
fi

echo "Deployment complete"
```

### CI/CD Integration

#### GitHub Actions

```yaml
- name: Clear cache
  run: |
    curl -s -f https://example.com/tcms/emergency/cache/clear || echo "Cache clear failed"
```

#### GitLab CI

```yaml
deploy:
  script:
    - curl -s -f https://example.com/tcms/emergency/cache/clear || echo "Cache clear failed"
```

### What Gets Cleared

The cache clear endpoint clears:

- **Filesystem cache** - Cached templates and computed data
- **OPcache** - PHP bytecode cache
- **APCu** - In-memory application cache (if enabled)
- **Redis** - Redis cache (if configured)
- **Memcached** - Memcached cache (if configured)
- **Image cache** - Processed/watermarked images
- **Cache version** - Forces cache invalidation across all backends


## Troubleshooting Deployments

### Changes Not Appearing

1. Clear the cache using the endpoint above
2. Check that OPcache is clearing (may require PHP-FPM restart)
3. Verify CDN cache is cleared if using one

### Cache Clear Endpoint Not Working

If the endpoint returns an error:

1. Check that the site is accessible
2. Review PHP error logs
3. As a fallback, restart PHP-FPM: `systemctl restart php-fpm`

### Permission Issues After Deployment

Ensure the web server user has write access to:

- `tcms-data/` - Content storage
- `tcms/cache/` - Template cache
- `tcms/logs/` - Application logs
- `tcms/tmp/` - Temporary files

```bash
chown -R www-data:www-data tcms-data tcms/cache tcms/logs tcms/tmp
```

## Symlink Versioned Deployments

For zero-downtime updates with instant rollback, you can use versioned directories with a symlink. This is the same pattern used by Capistrano, Laravel Envoyer, and similar deployment tools.

### Directory Structure

```
/var/www/example.com/
├── tcms -> tcms-3.3.0/          # symlink to active version
├── tcms-3.2.2/                  # previous version (kept for rollback)
├── tcms-3.3.0/                  # current version
├── tcms-data/                   # shared data (never changes between versions)
└── public/
    └── index.php                # references tcms/ (follows symlink)
```

### Deploying a New Version

```bash
# Upload or extract the new version
unzip totalcms-3.3.0.zip -d /var/www/example.com/tcms-3.3.0

# Switch the symlink (atomic operation)
cd /var/www/example.com
ln -sfn tcms-3.3.0 tcms

# Clear cache
php tcms/resources/bin/tcms cache:clear
```

The `ln -sfn` command atomically replaces the symlink. There is no moment where the application is unavailable — requests in progress continue using the old version, and new requests use the new one.

### Rolling Back

```bash
cd /var/www/example.com
ln -sfn tcms-3.2.2 tcms
php tcms/resources/bin/tcms cache:clear
```

### Cleanup

Keep one or two previous versions for rollback, then remove older ones:

```bash
# Remove old versions (keep current and one previous)
rm -rf tcms-3.2.1/
```

### Notes

- `tcms-data/` is shared across all versions — it sits outside the versioned directories and is never touched during deployments
- The `cache/`, `logs/`, and `tmp/` directories inside each version can be symlinked to shared directories if needed, or left as-is (they're recreated automatically)
- This approach works well with CI/CD pipelines — your build step creates the versioned directory, and the deploy step switches the symlink
- The built-in one-click updater in the admin dashboard uses a simpler backup-and-swap approach. The symlink pattern is for teams that manage their own deployment process
