## Clear Button

Select fields include a clear button (x) that appears when a value is selected, allowing users to quickly reset the selection. This feature is enabled by default but can be disabled using the `clearValue` setting.

```json
{
	"clearValue" : false
}
```

When enabled (default), a circular clear button appears on the right side of the select field whenever a value is selected. Clicking it clears the selection and returns to the placeholder state.
