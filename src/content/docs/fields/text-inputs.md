## Text Input Settings (text, url, tel, phone, etc.)

The following can be used on text fields to limit the number of characters.

```json
{
  "maxlength" : 100,
  "minlength" : 10,
  "pattern"   : "/ab+c/",
  "readonly"  : true,
  "disabled"  : true,
  "class"     : "custom-class"
}
```

## Textarea Settings

```json
{
  "rows" : 10
}
```

### Auto-grow

A textarea sizes itself to its content as the user types, growing and shrinking with the text. The `rows` setting is the floor: the field never gets shorter than that many lines, so an empty field still shows its full height. It stops growing at a `max-height` of 60vh, after which the internal scrollbar takes over.

This is plain CSS, the `field-sizing: content` property, so it works on public forms and in the admin with no script. On desktop the corner resize handle still works: drag it and the field keeps the size you chose. On touch devices, where the handle is hard to grab, growing with the content is how the field gets taller.

### Disabling auto-grow

Set `autoGrow: false` in the settings object when you want a strictly
fixed-height textarea, exactly `rows` lines tall, with an internal scrollbar (e.g., a "short summary"
field where you want to discourage long content).

```json
{
  "rows"     : 3,
  "autoGrow" : false
}
```

## Text Transform

Automatically transform text on save. Useful for enforcing consistent casing (e.g., names, titles).

```json
{
  "textTransform" : "titlecase"
}
```

| Value | Input | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `lowercase` | `JOHN DOE` | `john doe` |
| `uppercase` | `john doe` | `JOHN DOE` |
| `titlecase` | `john doe` | `John Doe` |
| `sentencecase` | `john doe` | `John doe` |
| `smart-titlecase` | `JOHN DOE` | `John Doe` |
| `smart-sentencecase` | `JOHN DOE` | `John doe` |

The transform is applied server-side on save, so it works regardless of how data is entered (admin, API, CLI, or import). It only applies to plain text — HTML content (styled text) is not affected.

The `smart-` variants only transform text that is entirely uppercase or entirely lowercase. If the text is already mixed case, it is left unchanged. This is useful for name fields where you want to fix `MARIA DE SILVA` → `Maria De Silva` but leave `Maria de Silva` alone if someone typed it correctly.

### Schema Example

```json
{
  "firstName": {
    "type": "string",
    "label": "First Name",
    "field": "text",
    "settings": {
      "textTransform": "titlecase"
    }
  }
}
```

## Purifying HTML in Text

Default all text will be scanned for HTML and sanitized to help prevent from XSS attacks.
You can disable this by setting the following.

```json
{
  "htmlclean" : false
}
```
