## Text Input Settings (text, url, tel, phone, etc.)

The following can be used on text fields to limit the number of characters.

```json
{
  "maxlength" : 100,
  "minlength" : 10,
  "pattern"   : "/ab+c/",
  "readonly"  : true,
  "disabled"  : true,
  "class"     : "custom-class"
}
```

## Textarea Settings

```json
{
  "rows" : 10
}
```

### Auto-grow

Textareas auto-grow as the user types, expanding to fit content up to a
`max-height` of 60vh (after which the internal scrollbar takes over). The
`rows` setting controls the *initial* height; the field grows beyond that
as content is added.

On desktop, the corner resize handle still works — drag it to make the
field larger and that manual size is preserved across subsequent edits.
The textarea never auto-shrinks once expanded, avoiding layout jitter
when content is deleted. This is the same behavior Slack, Gmail, and
GitHub use for comment fields.

On touch devices (iPad, iPhone), the corner handle is hard to grab
precisely, so auto-grow is the primary way the field expands. This is
what fixes the long-standing "can't make my textarea taller on iPad"
complaint.

### Disabling auto-grow

Set `autoGrow: false` in the settings object when you want a strictly
fixed-height textarea with an internal scrollbar (e.g., a "short summary"
field where you want to discourage long content).

```json
{
  "rows"     : 3,
  "autoGrow" : false
}
```

## Text Transform

Automatically transform text on save. Useful for enforcing consistent casing (e.g., names, titles).

```json
{
  "textTransform" : "titlecase"
}
```

| Value | Input | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `lowercase` | `JOHN DOE` | `john doe` |
| `uppercase` | `john doe` | `JOHN DOE` |
| `titlecase` | `john doe` | `John Doe` |
| `sentencecase` | `john doe` | `John doe` |
| `smart-titlecase` | `JOHN DOE` | `John Doe` |
| `smart-sentencecase` | `JOHN DOE` | `John doe` |

The transform is applied server-side on save, so it works regardless of how data is entered (admin, API, CLI, or import). It only applies to plain text — HTML content (styled text) is not affected.

The `smart-` variants only transform text that is entirely uppercase or entirely lowercase. If the text is already mixed case, it is left unchanged. This is useful for name fields where you want to fix `MARIA DE SILVA` → `Maria De Silva` but leave `Maria de Silva` alone if someone typed it correctly.

### Schema Example

```json
{
  "firstName": {
    "type": "string",
    "label": "First Name",
    "field": "text",
    "settings": {
      "textTransform": "titlecase"
    }
  }
}
```

## Purifying HTML in Text

Default all text will be scanned for HTML and sanitized to help prevent from XSS attacks.
You can disable this by setting the following.

```json
{
  "htmlclean" : false
}
```
