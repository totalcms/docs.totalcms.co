title: "Property Options"
description: "Auto-populate select options and datalists from existing field values in a Total CMS collection for dynamic, data-driven form fields."
---
Get all values of a field and populate as select options or datalist. This dynamically generates the options list from existing data in the collection.

```json
{
	"propertyOptions" : true
}
```

When enabled, Total CMS scans all objects in the collection for unique values of the field and presents them as options. This is useful for fields like categories or tags where you want the options to reflect what's already been used.
