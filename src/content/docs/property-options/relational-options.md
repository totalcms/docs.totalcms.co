description: "Link form field options to another Total CMS collection or DataView with multi-field labels, include and exclude filtering for relational data."

The default value of the options is always the ID of the object. This is useful to
list all of the objects from another collection.

```json
{
  "relationalOptions" : {
  	"collection" : "feed",
  	"label"      : "title",
  	"value"      : "id"
  }
}
```

## Using a DataView

Instead of referencing a collection directly, you can populate options from a [DataView](/docs/dataviews). Use the `view` key instead of `collection`. The `view` and `collection` settings are mutually exclusive.

```json
{
  "relationalOptions" : {
  	"view"  : "my-dataview",
  	"label" : "title",
  	"value" : "id"
  }
}
```

All other settings (`label`, `value`, `join`, `include`, `exclude`) work the same way with DataView-backed options.

## Multiple Fields in Label

You can combine multiple fields in the label using the `join` parameter. This allows you to display more descriptive labels by combining multiple properties from the related object.

```json
{
  "relationalOptions" : {
  	"collection" : "authors",
  	"label"      : "firstName lastName",
  	"value"      : "id",
  	"join"       : " "
  }
}
```

In this example, the label will display "John Doe" by combining the `firstName` and `lastName` fields with a space. The `join` parameter defaults to a single space `" "` if not specified.

## Advanced Examples

**Combine with separator:**
```json
{
  "relationalOptions" : {
  	"collection" : "products",
  	"label"      : "name, category",
  	"value"      : "id",
  	"join"       : ", "
  }
}
```
This will create labels like "Product Name - Category Name".

**Three fields:**
```json
{
  "relationalOptions" : {
  	"collection" : "users",
  	"label"      : "firstName,lastName,email",
  	"value"      : "id",
  	"join"       : ","
  }
}
```
This will create labels like "John | Doe | john@example.com".

## Filtering Relational Options

You can filter which objects appear in relational dropdowns using `include` and `exclude` filters. This is useful for showing only published content, excluding drafts, or filtering by any object property.

> **See [Index Filter Documentation](/api/index-filter/) for complete filtering syntax and examples.**

**Basic filtering:**
```json
{
  "relationalOptions" : {
  	"collection" : "blog",
  	"label"      : "title",
  	"value"      : "id",
  	"exclude"    : "draft:true"
  }
}
```
This will show all blog posts except drafts in the dropdown.

**Include only specific items:**
```json
{
  "relationalOptions" : {
  	"collection" : "products",
  	"label"      : "name",
  	"value"      : "id",
  	"include"    : "instock:true"
  }
}
```
This will show only in-stock products.

**Combined filters:**
```json
{
  "relationalOptions" : {
  	"collection" : "blog",
  	"label"      : "title",
  	"value"      : "id",
  	"include"    : "published:true",
  	"exclude"    : "draft:true,archived:true"
  }
}
```
This will show only published posts that are not drafts or archived.

**Shorthand syntax:**
```json
{
  "relationalOptions" : {
  	"collection" : "events",
  	"label"      : "name",
  	"value"      : "id",
  	"include"    : "featured",
  	"exclude"    : "cancelled"
  }
}
```
When no value is provided, it defaults to `true` (e.g., `featured` = `featured:true`).

**Array field filtering:**
```json
{
  "relationalOptions" : {
  	"collection" : "blog",
  	"label"      : "title",
  	"value"      : "id",
  	"include"    : "tags:featured",
  	"exclude"    : "tags:archived"
  }
}
```
Filters work with array fields like `tags` or `categories` by checking if the value exists in the array.

## Filter Logic

- **include** - Object must match ALL specified criteria (AND logic)
- **exclude** - Object is excluded if it matches ANY criteria (OR logic)
- **Precedence** - Exclude takes precedence over include
- **Array fields** - Checks if value exists within array (case-insensitive for strings)
- **String values** - Case-insensitive matching for flexibility
- **Boolean values** - Strict comparison for optimal performance

Multiple filters are comma-separated: `"exclude": "draft:true,private:true"`
